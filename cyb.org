* DONE fix failing cli args parsing.  
  it is meant to be working perfectly, but no.
  
* TODO fix syntranses
  for example, disbracket is not working perfectly.

* TODO add prepare syntrans
  it has to convert agidel ast to scheme code, converting function
  invocatoins to what they need to be and etc.

* TODO add aeval syntrans
  it is a simple wrapper around chicken interpreter.
